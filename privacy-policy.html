        <h1>Privacy Policy for CaroX Game</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 27, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how CaroX collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application, CaroX Game (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Usage Data (Analytics):</strong> We may collect information about how you interact with our Service. This may include features used, game session duration, buttons clicked, and general gameplay statistics. This data is typically anonymized or aggregated and helps us understand how players use our game so we can improve it.
                <em>(Optional: If you use a specific service, mention it: e.g., "We use services like Firebase Analytics for this purpose.")</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Crash Reports and Device Information:</strong> If the Service crashes, we may collect information about the crash, including device type, operating system version, and other technical information relevant to the crash. This helps us diagnose and fix bugs.
                <em>(Optional: If you use a specific service, mention it: e.g., "We use services like Firebase Crashlytics for this purpose.")</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> Player names or preferences you set within the game (e.g., for local multiplayer) are stored solely on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Information You Provide Voluntarily:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., for support), we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <em>(Important: If you collect ANY other data, like email addresses for account creation, user IDs, etc., you MUST list it here.)</em>
        <em>(If you use ads, you MUST add a section about ad providers like AdMob and link to their privacy policies.)</em>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our Service;</li>
            <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our Service;</li>
            <li>Understand and analyze how you use our Service;</li>
            <li>Develop new products, services, features, and functionality;</li>
            <li>Identify and fix bugs and crashes;</li>
            <li>Communicate with you, directly or through one of our partners, including for customer service, if you contact us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        <p>We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as analytics providers or crash reporting services. These providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service, protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or protect against legal liability.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 {or specify the relevant age in your target regions, e.g., 16 in some parts of Europe}. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>
        <em>(If your app IS targeted at children, you have significant additional obligations under laws like COPPA and GDPR-K. This paragraph would need to be very different, and you'd likely need a more robust policy and consent mechanisms.)</em>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
